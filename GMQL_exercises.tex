% This is a simple template for a LaTeX document using the "article" class.
% See "book", "report", "letter" for other types of document.

\documentclass[11pt]{article} % use larger type; default would be 10pt

\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % set input encoding (not needed with XeLaTeX)

%%% Examples of Article customizations
% These packages are optional, depending whether you want the features they provide.
% See the LaTeX Companion or other references for full information.

%%% PAGE DIMENSIONS
\usepackage{geometry} % to change the page dimensions
\geometry{a4paper} % or letterpaper (US) or a5paper or....
% \geometry{margin=2in} % for example, change the margins to 2 inches all round
% \geometry{landscape} % set up the page for landscape
%   read geometry.pdf for detailed page layout information

\usepackage{graphicx} % support the \includegraphics command and options

% \usepackage[parfill]{parskip} % Activate to begin paragraphs with an empty line rather than an indent

%%% PACKAGES
\usepackage{booktabs} % for much better looking tables
\usepackage{array} % for better arrays (eg matrices) in maths
\usepackage{paralist} % very flexible & customisable lists (eg. enumerate/itemize, etc.)
\usepackage{verbatim} % adds environment for commenting out blocks of text & for better verbatim
\usepackage{subfig} % make it possible to include more than one captioned figure/table in a single float
% These packages are all incorporated in the memoir class to one degree or another...

\section{Exercise 1}

\begin{lstlisting}
# Among the different epigenetic signals, H3K27ac and H3K27me3 are generally 
# associated with active and repressed chromatin regions, respectively. 
# Considering H3K4me1 in cell line A549 and the aforementioned signals 
# (H3K27ac and H3K27me3) in broadPeak format, under ethanol treatment (EtOH)

K4me1EtOH  = SELECT(cell == 'A549' AND treatment == 'EtOH_0.02pct' AND antibody == 'H3K4me1' ) HG19_ENCODE_BROAD;
K27acEtOH  = SELECT(cell == 'A549' AND treatment == 'EtOH_0.02pct' AND antibody == 'H3K27ac' ) HG19_ENCODE_BROAD;
K27me3EtOH = SELECT(cell == 'A549' AND treatment == 'EtOH_0.02pct' AND antibody == 'H3K27me3') HG19_ENCODE_BROAD;

Promoters  = SELECT(annotation_type == 'promoter') HG19_BED_ANNOTATION;

ActiveUnion = UNION() K4me1EtOH K27acEtOH;
ActiveOverlapping = COVER(2, ANY) ActiveUnion;
Active = MAP() ActiveUnion ActiveOverlapping;

RepressedUnion = UNION() K4me1EtOH K27me3EtOH;
RepressedOverlapping =  COVER(2, ANY) RepressedUnion;
Repressed = MAP() RepressedUnion RepressedOverlapping;

PoisedUnion = UNION() Repressed Active;
PoisedOverlapping = COVER(2, ANY) PoisedUnion;

ActiveInPromotersUnion = UNION() Active Promoters;
ActiveInPromotersOverlapping = COVER(2, ANY) ActiveInPromotersUnion;

ClosestK4me1FartherThan10k = JOIN(DGE(10000), MD(1); output: cat) ActiveInPromoters K4me1EtOH;

MATERIALIZE ClosestK4me1FartherThan10k INTO Result;
\end{lstlisting}

This job runned in about 2 minutes (113 sec), I obtained three sample, without duplicate.
The join is expliciting asking for one element, father than 10000 from the anchor in ``ActiveInPromoter'' from the ``K4me1EtOH''.

\section{Exercise 2}

\begin{lstlisting}
Sample = SELECT(antibody_target == 'JUN' AND (treatment == 'IFNa30' OR treatment == 'None')) HG19_ENCODE_NARROW;
Promoters  = SELECT(annotation_type == 'promoter') HG19_BED_ANNOTATION;

SampleOverlapping = COVER(2, ANY) Sample;
SampleIntersect = MAP() Sample SampleOverlapping;

SampleAndPromotersUnion = UNION() Promoters SampleIntersect;
SampleAndPromotersOverlapping = COVER(2, ANY) SampleAndPromotersUnion;
SampleAndPromoters = MAP() Promoters SampleAndPromotersOverlapping;

MATERIALIZE SampleAndPromoters INTO Result;
